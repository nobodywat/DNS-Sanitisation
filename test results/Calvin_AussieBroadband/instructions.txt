These steps should be carried out in one sitting.

1. Make sure your DNS server is set to the ISP default
2. Make sure your local firewall is turned off
3. (On Mac) Make sure apple private relay is turned off
4. Check your network connection at https://www.fusionconnect.com/speed-test-plus. A decent download and upload speed, and jitter value less than 10 should be ok.
5. Screenshot your fusionconnect result page.
6. Install the dnspython package "pip install dnspython"

Sanitisation
1. Run “python3 sanitizer-tcp-resolver.py Pirate-Copyright-Domains.txt”
2. Run “python3 sanitizer-tcp-resolver.py Malware-Malicious-Domains.txt”
3. Run “python3 sanitizer-tcp-resolver.py Fake-Phishing-Domains.txt”

As a result, 3 txt files will be created:
	- “Ready-For-Analyzer-Pirate-Copyright-Domains.txt”
	- “Ready-For-Analyzer-Malware-Malicious-Domains.txt"
	- "Ready-For-Analyzer-Fake-Phishing-Domains.txt"

Analysis
1. Run "python3 analyzer.py Ready-For-Analyzer-Pirate-Copyright-Domains.txt australian-ipv4-cidr.txt"
2. Run "python3 analyzer.py Ready-For-Analyzer-Malware-Malicious-Domains.txt australian-ipv4-cidr.txt"
3. Run "python3 analyzer.py Ready-For-Analyzer-Fake-Phishing-Domains.txt australian-ipv4-cidr.txt"

As a result, 3 folders will be created:
	- Ready-For-Analyzer-Pirate-Copyright-Domains
	- Ready-For-Analyzer-Malware-Malicious-Domains
	- Ready-For-Analyzer-Fake-Phishing-Domains

Results
1. Create a new folder called "<your-name>_<your-isp>"
2. Copy the 3 folders into this folder.
3. Fill out test register.
